## Overview

The goal of this project was to build a complete marketing page from a design, using only pure HTML and CSS without any frameworks. The layout includes several complex sections—such as a hero, social proof, asymmetrical grids, and sections with skewed backgrounds—demonstrating proficiency in advanced CSS techniques.

## Features

- **Modern & Attractive Design:** A clean and professional interface designed to engage users.
- **Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, from small mobile phones to large desktops, using Media Queries.
- **Semantic Structure:** Correct use of HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **Modern & Organized CSS:**
  - Extensive use of **CSS Variables (Design Tokens)** for a consistent and easily maintainable design system.
  - Complex layouts built with **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, including the use of `grid-template-areas` for visual grids.
  - Visual effects like skewed backgrounds (`transform: skewY`) and subtle transitions for an enhanced user experience.
- **Component-Based Code:** Reusable styles for components like buttons and cards, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layouts, and responsiveness.

## How to Run

This is a static project, so no dependency installation is required.

3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser of choice.

    > **Tip:** For a better development experience, you can use a Visual Studio Code extension like **Live Server**, which automatically reloads the page on code changes.
